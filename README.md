# A demo dataset for animal disease

Between 2015 and 2018, the PREDICT program in Malaysia tested a total of nine moonrats (_Echinosorex gymnura_) for various viruses, including paramyxoviruses (the group that includes viruses like Nipah virus, Hendra virus, and measles). They tested 17 samples from those 9 individuals, examining a mix of oral and rectal swabs. One came back positive, leading to the discovery of a new virus: PREDICT PMV-120.
